I remember the summer of my junior year in college, a time that felt like a whirlwind of excitement and anxiety all rolled into one. I had just finished my exams, and the thought of a long, carefree summer stretched out before me. My friends and I decided to take a spontaneous road trip to the beach. It was a classic case of “let’s just go!” without much planning, which, looking back, was both thrilling and a bit reckless.

We packed up my friend Jake’s old van, which was more rust than vehicle at that point, and hit the road. I was the one who insisted on bringing snacks—lots of them. I had a knack for picking out the best road trip snacks: chips, candy, and a few healthy options that I thought would balance things out. I mean, who doesn’t love a good mix of salty and sweet? But in my excitement, I forgot to check if we had enough water. Classic me, right? 

As we drove, the energy in the van was electric. We blasted music, sang along, and shared stories. I was in my element, talking a mile a minute, trying to keep the mood light and fun. I loved being the center of attention, and I could feel the laughter bubbling up around me. But as the miles rolled on, I started to feel a twinge of anxiety creeping in. What if we didn’t find a good place to stay? What if we ran out of gas? What if we got lost? I tried to shake it off, but it lingered in the back of my mind.

We finally arrived at the beach, and it was everything we had hoped for. The sun was shining, the waves were crashing, and the smell of salt in the air was invigorating. We set up our spot on the sand, and I immediately felt a wave of relief wash over me. This was what I needed—a break from the stress of school and the pressure of exams. I dove into the water, feeling the coolness envelop me, and for a moment, all my worries faded away.

But then, as the day went on, I noticed something. Jake and I had a bit of a competitive streak between us. We both wanted to be the one to suggest the best activities, the best places to eat, and the best ways to spend our time. It turned into a bit of a game, and I found myself getting a little too caught up in it. I wanted to be the one who planned the perfect beach bonfire, the one who found the best local seafood joint. I could feel the tension building, and I didn’t want to let it show. 

That evening, we gathered around a fire, roasting marshmallows and sharing stories. I was in my element again, but I could feel the competitive edge creeping back in. I started to notice little things that bothered me—like how Jake kept interrupting me when I was trying to tell a story. I shot him a look, and he just laughed it off, but inside, I was fuming. I didn’t want to ruin the night, but I also didn’t want to be overshadowed. 

As the fire crackled, I decided to take a step back. I needed to breathe. I wandered down to the water’s edge, letting the waves lap at my feet. The moonlight shimmered on the surface, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. I realized that I was letting my anxiety and competitiveness get the best of me. I didn’t want to be that person who ruined a good time over something so trivial. 

I took a deep breath and headed back to the group. I joined in on the laughter, letting go of my frustrations. I even challenged Jake to a friendly game of beach volleyball, which turned out to be a blast. We were both competitive, but it was all in good fun, and I could feel the tension dissipating. 

The rest of the trip was a blur of laughter, late-night talks, and spontaneous adventures. We explored local shops, tried new foods, and even went on a late-night swim. I felt alive, surrounded by friends who brought out the best in me. But I also learned something important about myself: I didn’t have to be the best or the center of attention all the time. Sometimes, it was enough just to be present and enjoy the moment.

As we packed up to head home, I felt a mix of sadness and gratitude. I had faced my anxieties, let go of my need to compete, and embraced the chaos of spontaneity. The trip wasn’t perfect, but it was real, and it was ours. I realized that life is about the moments we share, the laughter we create, and the memories we make, not about being the best or having everything planned out perfectly.

Driving back, I felt lighter. I was still me—energetic, talkative, and a little anxious—but I had learned to embrace the unpredictability of life. And as we rolled down the highway, I couldn’t help but smile, knowing that this summer adventure would be one for the books.
